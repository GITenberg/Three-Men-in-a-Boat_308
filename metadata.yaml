description: "Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog), published in 1889,\
  \ is a humorous account by English writer Jerome K. Jerome of a two-week boating\
  \ holiday on the Thames from Kingston upon Thames to Oxford and back to Kingston.\
  \ The book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of\
  \ local history along the route, but the humorous elements took over to the point\
  \ where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages seem a distraction to the\
  \ comic novel. One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated\
  \ it appears to modern readers â€“ the jokes seem fresh and witty even today.\nThe\
  \ three men are based on Jerome himself (the narrator Jerome K. Jerome) and two\
  \ real-life friends, George Wingrave (who would become a senior manager at Barclays\
  \ Bank) and Carl Hentschel (the founder of a London printing business, called Harris\
  \ in the book), with whom Jerome often took boating trips. The dog, Montmorency,\
  \ is entirely fictional but, \"as Jerome admits, developed out of that area of inner\
  \ consciousness which, in all Englishmen, contains an element of the dog.\" The\
  \ trip is a typical boating holiday of the time in a Thames camping skiff. This\
  \ was just after commercial boat traffic on the Upper Thames had died out, replaced\
  \ by the 1880s craze for boating as a leisure activity.\nFollowing the overwhelming\
  \ success of Three Men in a Boat, Jerome later published a sequel, about a cycling\
  \ tour in Germany, titled Three Men on the Bummel (also known as Three Men on Wheels,\
  \ 1900).\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
